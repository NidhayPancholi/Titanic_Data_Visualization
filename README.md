# Titanic Dataset Analysis and Machine Learning on Kaggle

## Overview
The Titanic dataset provides comprehensive passenger information, including survival status, class, fare, etc.[1]. This repository features fundamental data munging, analysis, and visualization techniques, accompanied by examples of supervised machine learning methods[2]. It also illustrates the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process applied to the Titanic dataset from Kaggle[4]. Additionally, the repository showcases training models and generating visualizations using Ludwig[3].
